# Mad Scientist App

An app to control the Shark Rover as built by the [Mad Scientist Lab](https://github.com/javaplus/MadScientist).

## Install  
### iOS
To install on Apple Products grab [Mad Scientist Controls](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mad-scientist-controls/id6739670168) from the Apple Store.

### Android
For Android you need to side load the APK. You may need to modify your phone settings to allow installation via an APK.
To install an APK from an unknown source on Android (Android 8+), go to **Settings > Apps > Special access > Install unknown apps**, then select the app you'll use (like Chrome or a File Manager) and toggle "Allow from this source" on. Older Android versions used a single "Unknown sources" toggle in Security settings.   
Find our **Android APK** in [Releases](https://github.com/javaplus/mad_scientist_app/releases) . Just Grab the latest `app-release.apk`.


### Bluetooth enalbed PC
You can use a browser to control the rover as well, assuming your browser allows bluetooth control. This may require changing browser settings to allow this.
